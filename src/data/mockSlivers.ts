    content: `if you were a book 
I'd read each page twice
Would go beyond the words
In that book of paradise. 

if you were the night sky
I'd count all the stars 
Would look at the moon
And consider you art. 

And if you were a song
I'd pay attention to the lyrics 
The melody and beauty
Ignoring the critics. 

If you were a rose,
I would keep you inside my dairy
I'm afraid your divine fragrance 
could Ruin me entirely. 

And if you were the silence 
I'd look for words in it.
But You'll be the peace
Beacuse silence is peaceful i admit. 

If you were a river
I'd come and flow with you
I'd let you drown me
All in that water blue. 

If you were rain 
I'd let you touch each part of me
And if you were the rainbow
I would reflect the colors of thee. 

Of Everything, if you were
I would have been a part of you i know it
But if you were a poem,
I would have been the poet.`,

The sailor who set out chasing the horizon is long dead—
not lost to the sea,
but to the journey itself.

Each wave demanded more than it returned.
Each dream, once chased, came back thinner,
heavier with hunger.

What survived was not hope, but misery—
a body still breathing,
a soul already spent.

The reason faded. The resolve eroded.
Even rebellion grew tired.

In the end, the dream did not fail—
it arrived as ash.`,

    content: `The sacrifice you made meant nothing to them.
Yet I wept—
not for your death,
but because I did not burn in your stead.

I now bear the chaos that took you from me.
I will wear it as sin, as crown, as curse.

The being that demanded your life will know flame.
Not in vengeance alone,
but in judgment—
for calling a wager a sacrifice,
and naming cruelty as necessity.

Let the realms burn if they must.
Let their thrones collapse and turn to ash,
so that the prosperity you believed in
may finally take root.

Let its flowers bloom from my remains,
nourished by a sin that ends with me.

And when the last ember fades,
I will kneel before you, my maiden—
bearing the blade myself,
so that even in death
no other hands must be stained as mine were.`,
